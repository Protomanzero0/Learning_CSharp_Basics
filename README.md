# Overview

This is just a simple little program that I wrote to learn the ropes of C#, with the goal of later creating a game using the language. It coveres most basic concepts, including:
- Variable assignment
- Expressions
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Classes
- Structures
- Reading from and writing to files


I'll be using what I learned to make a simple game in C# to get better acquainted with the language and using a proper IDE

# Development Environment

This project was created using Visual Studio's C# compiler using the default libraries. 

# Useful Websites

Some resources I found useful for this project:

- [RB Whitaker's C# Crash Course](http://rbwhitaker.wikidot.com/c-sharp-tutorials)
- [Microsoft's Official C# Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/)

# Future Work

Some things to improve in the future:

- Code layout/ Clarity; having class and function definitions stored at the bottom of the document file is new to me, so I'll need to work on better organization
- Writing Efficiency
